### High Level Plan
We plan to have every group member complete their primary portions early in each week so that we can then have the team members review their secondary portions the day after. We will test integrating various aspects as often as possible, we each group member trying to keep the master branch updated with their work. Group members should only ever commit fully functioning code to the master branch, which they will do after testing this code thoroughly.
