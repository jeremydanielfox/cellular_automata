Refactored Cell_society_team12
We refactored the FourNeighborToroid class in Team 12's code. This was written by Jeremy Fox, and Jeremy and Brandon Choi refactored it together. The main problem in this code was that there were two almost identical methods except for one line in each that was doing something different, so we combined these into one method with an if statement to differentiate between them. By doing this, we eliminated about ten lines of duplicated code.
